# Connect 4

"Challenge a friend to rule the grid in Connect 4 Classic Grid, the game where strategy drives the competition! Line ‘em up and go for the win! Choose the gold discs or the red discs and drop them into the grid. When you get 4 discs in a row, you win. It’s simple, fast, and fun. Master the grid." -Hasbro

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to have a set of instructions on how to play the game, in case that I've never heard the game before
- As a user, I want to be able to select the column I want to place my chip and when I select the spot my chip will be displayed in the grid
- As a user, I want to be able to play with a second player so that the game is more entertaining
- As a user, I want the player to automatically to switch player's chips so that it's easier for users to know when their turn is
- As a user, when I win I want a message to show in the page indicating which player has won. If there's no winner by the traditional way of choosing a winner, I want to see a message to display indicating the reason why the game ended
- As a user, I want to have an button to restart the game without having to go inside the link multiple times
- As a user, I want to add points to my name when I win a game

## Rules

All you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting four in a row.

## How to win
**Get four in a row first.**
- In Connect 4 Grid it’s all about strategy.
- Pick your favorite way to win (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).
- Release a disc to open up new options.
